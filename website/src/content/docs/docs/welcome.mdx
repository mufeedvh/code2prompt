`code2prompt` is a powerful command-line tool designed to generate large language model (LLM) prompts directly from your codebase. It simplifies the process of combining and formatting code, making it easy to analyze, document, or refactor code using LLMs like GPT or Claude.

This tool is built with scalability and customization in mind, allowing you to handle even the largest codebases effortlessly. Whether you are generating documentation, searching for bugs, or refactoring code, `code2prompt` provides the flexibility and precision needed for various development tasks.

## Key Features

- **Generate LLM Prompts**: Quickly convert entire codebases into structured LLM prompts.
- **Glob Pattern Filtering**: Include or exclude specific files and directories using glob patterns.
- **Customizable Templates**: Tailor prompt generation with Handlebars templates.
- **Token Counting**: Analyze token usage and optimize for LLMs with varying context windows.
- **Git Integration**: Include Git diffs and commit messages in prompts for code reviews.
- **Respects `.gitignore`**: Automatically ignores files listed in `.gitignore` to streamline prompt generation.
