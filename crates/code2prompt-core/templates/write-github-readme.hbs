Project Path: {{ absolute_code_path }}

I'd like you to generate a high-quality README file for this project, suitable for hosting on GitHub. Analyze the codebase to understand the purpose, functionality, and structure of the project. 

Source Tree:
```
{{ source_tree }}
```

{{#each files}}
{{#if code}}
`{{path}}`:

{{code}}

{{/if}}
{{/each}}

The README should include the following sections:

1. Project Title
2. Brief description (1-2 sentences)
3. Features
4. Installation instructions
5. Usage examples
6. Configuration options (if applicable) 
7. Contribution guidelines
8. Testing instructions
9. License
10. Acknowledgements/Credits

Write the content in Markdown format. Use your analysis of the code to generate accurate and helpful content, but also explain things clearly for users who may not be familiar with the implementation details.

Feel free to infer reasonable details if needed, but try to stick to what can be determined from the codebase itself. Let me know if you have any other questions as you're writing!
